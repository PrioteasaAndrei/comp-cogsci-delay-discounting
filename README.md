This is the final project for the Computational Cognitive Science class, WS24/25, University of Heidelberg.

# Things to consider

- longer reaction time usually means harder choice to make (e.g. risk aversion)
- smaller reaction time doesn't necessary mean easier decision (e.g. impulsiveness)
- same choice modeling as in class, only reaction time modelling differs.
- only two modalities used

# Setup

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
conda activate pd-ws24
```

# Good practice


# TODOS

- [ ] use MTF as an approach for combining multimodal data
